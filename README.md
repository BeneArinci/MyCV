## Benedetta Arinci

I am an ordinary woman with an extraordinary passion for people. Always eager to learn and intrigued by finding the best solution to problems.
Since I moved to London, 4 years ago, I have been working as a recruiter. I built my career from scratch, starting from zero experience and a basic level of English. I am so proud of it that I wanted to do it again ðŸ’ª<br>
Why tech? In any other job, sooner or later, you'll stop learning. In tech you are always be able to keep on growing as much as you wish.
From what I have experienced so far, when I am coding I always feel outside my comfort zone. The more I learn, the more I feel like I need to learn more. Finding a solution to a problem pushes me to look for new and more challenging ones to solve. This is really an exciting feeling.<br>
I was able to get into Makers, one of the best software development bootcamps in Europe, accepting only 10% of applicants. I learnt so much during the last 4-5 months. I am now ready (and excited) to start my career as a software developer. The idea of working with a super team providing tech solution to real-life challenges thrills me ðŸ’— <br> 
Along with my recently built tech skills, I bring with me a solid set of soft skills that I built during my past working experience and studies that are really valuable when it comes to work with other people and I am looking forward to make use of all of them. Stronger together is my motto! ðŸ™Œ
