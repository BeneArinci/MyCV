# Benedetta Arinci

I am an ordinary woman with an extraordinary passion for people. Always eager to learn and intrigued by finding the best solution to problems.
Since I moved to London, 4 years ago, I have been working as a recruiter. I built my career from scratch, starting from zero experience and a basic level of English. I am so proud of it that I wanted to do it again ðŸ’ª<br>
Why tech? In any other job, sooner or later, you'll stop learning. In tech you are always be able to keep on growing as much as you wish.
From what I have experienced so far, when I am coding I always feel outside my comfort zone. The more I learn, the more I feel like I need to learn more. Finding a solution to a problem pushes me to look for new and more challenging ones to solve. This is really an exciting feeling.<br>
I was able to get into Makers, one of the best software development bootcamps in Europe, accepting only 10% of applicants. I learnt so much during the last 4-5 months. I am now ready (and excited) to start my career as a software developer. The idea of working with a super team providing tech solution to real-life challenges thrills me ðŸ’— <br> 
Along with my recently built tech skills, I bring with me a solid set of soft skills that I built during my past working experience and studies that are really valuable when it comes to work with other people and I am looking forward to make use of all of them. Stronger together is my motto! ðŸ™Œ


## Tech Skills

â€¢ **Languages** | JavaScript | Ruby | HTML | CSS | SQL<br>

â€¢ **Frameworks & Environments** | React | NodeJS | JQuery | Express | WebPack | Rails<br>
â€¢ **CI & CD** | TravisCI | Heroku | Netlify<br>
â€¢ **Databases** | PostgreSQL<br>

## Soft Skills

**Curiosity & Problem solving**<br>
Iâ€™m an active learner, I like to explore new technologies and apply what I learn in my
projects. I try to look at solutions from different points of view so to take a thought out decision. When I am in front of a challenge, I won't stop till I solve it. During the Coding Bootcamp I sharpened this specific skill applying it to software development and I demonstrated that I can do anything :)<br>
**Communication & Listening**<br>
I understand that clear communication is a key element in any collaborative environment. For this reason I try to be as clear as possible when I explain my ideas and I tend to ask questions and start a meaningful conversation when I feel that what I am working on is not clear enough to me. I am also an active listener and I do care of other people's opinion<br>
**Empathy & Team Working**<br>
I like to contribute in having a happy team and a respectful working environment. I
regularly ask for feedback from my peers so to improve in my behaviours and day to
day job and I always do my best to help identify ways to improve the teamâ€™s ways of
working<br>
**Stakeholder Management**<br>
I am always keen to understand my stakeholders' needs and to find the best solutions to satisfy them. As a recruiter I had the opportunity to work both with external (clients) and internal (hiring managers) stakeholders. The key to succeed was listening and ask for the right questions. I'll always bring knowledge this wiht me.

## Projects
| **Project** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [Bank Account](https://github.com/BeneArinci/Bank_Tech_Test)    | small client-side app developed using **JavaScript**, **Jasmine**, **ESLint**. It allows a user to create a bank account, to make deposits and withdrawals and to be able to print their bank statement in a specific format |
| [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/BeneArinci/Bowling-ScoreCard)| single page interactive web app developed using **JavaScript**, **JQuery**, **Jasmine**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**. It is easy to use. It allows the user to enter the points for each frame and it is constantly updating the score |
| [CodeQuest()](https://github.com/BeneArinci/CodeQuest) | platform game for children with the aim of helping them to develop problem solving skills and, possibly, bringing them closer to programming. This was my final group project, presented during the Makersâ€™ Demo Day on July 31 2020. The app was developed using the following tech stack: **JavaScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, **HTML5**, **CSS**, **Tachyons**, **Jest**. This app is deployed on Netlify and available online [here](https://lets-codequest.netlify.app/)|
| [Acebook](https://github.com/BeneArinci/Acebook) | group project I worked on during the bootcampâ€™s week 8 and 9. The aim was to create an app similar to FaceBook. Tech stack: **Ruby on Rails**, **RSpec**, **Capybara**, **PostgreSQL**, **HTML5**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, **Rubocop**, **Travis**. The app was deployed on Heroku but is no longer there |
